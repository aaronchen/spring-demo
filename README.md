# Spring Workshop

A growing full-stack application built as a hands-on learning project for Spring Boot 4.0, featuring both a REST API and an interactive web UI powered by Thymeleaf and HTMX. New features and patterns are added as we continue exploring Spring Boot together.

**Live Demo:** <a href="https://demo.desuka.cc" target="_blank">demo.desuka.cc</a>

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | `alice.johnson@example.com` | `password` |
| User | `bob.smith@example.com` | `password` |

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Form Login** - Email + password authentication with BCrypt hashing
- **Self-Registration** - New users can sign up; default role is USER
- **Role-Based Access** - Two roles: USER (standard) and ADMIN (elevated privileges)
- **Ownership Checks** - Users can edit/delete their own tasks and unassigned tasks; admins can access all
- **Admin Panel** - Modal-based user management (create/edit/delete/disable/enable) at `/admin/users`; tag management at `/admin/tags` (admin only)
- **Audit Logging** - All entity changes and auth events logged; admin audit page with search/filters at `/admin/audit`
- **Admin Settings** - Configurable site name, registration toggle, maintenance banner, notification purge age, and theme picker at `/admin/settings`
- **User Profile** - Self-service account management at `/profile`: edit name/email, change password, and configure preferences (task view mode, default user filter, due date reminders)
- **Auth-Aware UI** - Navbar shows user info, role badge, and role-appropriate links

### Web Interface
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly UI built with Bootstrap 5
- **Card, Table & Calendar Views** - Toggle between card grid, sortable table, and monthly calendar; preference persisted via user preferences
- **CSV Export** - Download filtered tasks as CSV; respects all active filters (search, status, priority, tags, user, overdue)
- **Real-time Search** - Filter tasks as you type (debounced, 300ms); clear button appears on input
- **Filter Buttons** - All / Open / In Progress / Completed / Overdue with color-coded active states
- **Priority Filter** - Dropdown filter for Low / Medium / High with color-coded button state
- **Sortable Columns** - Sort by title, created date, priority, due date, or description (ascending/descending)
- **Priority Badges** - Color-coded clickable badges (High=red, Medium=yellow, Low=green) with reception bar icons
- **Task Dates** - Optional start date and due date with overdue detection; overdue tasks highlighted in red; completedAt timestamp recorded when task is completed
- **Task Checklist** - Embeddable checklist items on tasks (text + checked state); drag-and-drop reordering via native HTML Drag and Drop API; checklist progress shown on cards and table rows; changes audited in activity timeline
- **Pagination** - Configurable page size (10/25/50/100); top and bottom controls
- **Modal Forms** - Create and edit tasks in a modal overlay; context (filters, search, sort) is preserved
- **Task Lifecycle** - Three-state status: OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED; toggle button advances through the cycle; status radio buttons in edit form
- **Status-Aware Reassignment** - Reassigning an in-progress task resets its status to OPEN
- **Color-Coded Tasks** - Green = completed, blue = in progress, yellow = open throughout UI
- **Dynamic Updates** - Toggle status and delete without page reloads via HTMX
- **User Assignment** - Assign tasks to users via searchable select dropdown (`@ManyToOne`)
- **Tags** - Tag tasks with multiple labels via checkboxes (`@ManyToMany`)
- **User & Tag Filters** - Filter tasks by assigned user and/or tags; clickable names/badges for quick filtering
- **Task Comments** - Any authenticated user can comment on any task; comment owners and admins can delete comments; real-time count updates via HTMX out-of-band swaps
- **@Mentions in Comments** - Type @ to mention users in comments with Tribute.js autocomplete; atomic backspace for mention tokens; clean display with encoded storage; mentioned users receive notifications and are subscribed to the conversation
- **Unified Activity Timeline** - Comments and audit history merged into a single chronological timeline with visual timeline dots and connecting lines; replaces separate comments panel and audit panel in both modal and full-page views
- **Shared Two-Column Layout** - Task modal and full-page task view share the same layout fragment (`task-layout.html`): form fields on left, checklist + activity timeline on right
- **Styled Confirm Dialog** - Bootstrap modal confirm dialog (`showConfirm`) replaces native browser `confirm()` for delete actions
- **Toast Notifications** - Success/error toasts for task save, delete, and conflict events; clickable toasts for notification links (Bootstrap 5 toasts with slide-in animation)
- **Online Presence** - Real-time online user count and list in navbar via WebSocket + STOMP
- **Notification Bell** - Real-time push notifications with unread badge, dropdown list, mark-as-read, and mark-all-as-read
- **Notifications Page** - Full paginated notification history at `/notifications` with clear-all; live updates via client-side event bus
- **Live Task Updates** - Stale-data banner on task list, detail page, and modal when another user modifies a task; click to refresh with current filters
- **Live Comment Updates** - Auto-refresh comment lists and counts when another user adds or deletes comments; works in both modal and full-page views
- **Real-Time Dashboard** - Personal stats (open/in-progress/completed/overdue) with clickable cards linking to filtered task list, system overview, due-this-week tasks, recent tasks, and activity feed; auto-refreshes via WebSocket on task and presence changes
- **Due Date Reminders** - Daily scheduled notifications for tasks due tomorrow; per-user opt-in/out via profile preferences
- **Theme System** - Three color schemes (Default, Workshop, Indigo) switchable from admin settings; CSS custom properties with FOUC prevention
- **Maintenance Banner** - Dismissible site-wide alert banner configurable from admin settings
- **Dynamic Site Name** - Customizable site name shown in navbar, footer, and page titles

### REST API
- **RESTful Endpoints** - Complete CRUD for tasks, tags, and users via JSON API
- **Data Validation** - Input validation with structured JSON error responses
- **Optimistic Locking** - `@Version` on Task entity; stale updates return 409 Conflict
- **Ownership Enforcement** - Task PUT/DELETE require owner or admin; POST auto-assigns to caller
- **Role Restrictions** - Tag and user mutations (POST/DELETE) restricted to admins
- **Search & Filter** - Query tasks by keyword and status
- **Toggle Status** - Quick PATCH endpoint advances task through OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED cycle
- **Task Comments** - Nested comment endpoints under each task
- **Notifications** - Unread count, paginated list, mark read, mark all read, clear all
- **Presence** - Online user count and list

### Audit Logging
- **Event-Driven** - Services publish audit events via `ApplicationEventPublisher`; listener persists to database
- **Tracked Actions** - Task CRUD, comment create/delete, user CRUD (including disable/enable), tag CRUD, settings changes, auth success/failure, role changes, registration, profile changes
- **Field-Level Diffs** - Update events record before/after values for each changed field
- **Admin Audit Page** - Searchable, filterable audit log at `/admin/audit` with dynamically generated category buttons (from `AuditEvent.CATEGORIES`), text search, date range, and pagination
- **Task History** - Per-task audit trail shown in unified activity timeline alongside comments

### Error Handling
- **Dual exception handlers** - `ApiExceptionHandler` returns JSON for REST; `WebExceptionHandler` returns Thymeleaf pages for web
- **Custom error pages** - 403 (Access Denied), 404 (Not Found), 409 (Conflict), 500 (Server Error)
- **Structured API errors** - Consistent JSON with `timestamp`, `status`, `error` fields

### Technical Highlights
- Spring Boot 4.0.3 with Java 25
- Spring Security 7.0 with form login, BCrypt, and role-based access control
- Custom Thymeleaf dialect (`${#auth}`) for ownership/role checks in templates
- H2 in-memory database (easy development setup)
- Spring Data JPA with Specifications for dynamic filtering
- Event-driven side effects — services publish domain events; three independent listeners handle audit logging, notifications, and WebSocket broadcasting
- Service-to-service composition (TaskService delegates to TagService/UserService/CommentService instead of direct repository access)
- Generic `@Unique` validation annotation — class-level, `@Repeatable`, uses `EntityManager` JPQL for uniqueness checks with self-exclusion on edit
- Global string trimming via `GlobalBindingConfig` (`StringTrimmerEditor`) — trims all form fields, converts blank to null
- User enable/disable pattern — disabled users can't log in and are hidden from assignment dropdowns; users with completed tasks or comments can only be disabled (not deleted)
- Entity `FIELD_*` constants for field names (no hardcoded strings in audit snapshots or specifications)
- `get`/`find` naming convention: `getXxx()` throws `EntityNotFoundException`, `findXxx()` returns null
- DTO layer (`TaskRequest` / `TaskResponse`) with MapStruct for compile-time mapping
- Thymeleaf with shared fragment architecture
- HTMX 2.0 for dynamic interactions, HX-Trigger events, and out-of-band swaps
- Tribute.js for @mention autocomplete in comment input
- Bootstrap 5.3 for styling
- Reusable pagination fragment with custom DOM events
- Typed `Settings` POJO with `BeanWrapper` auto-mapping from DB key/value rows
- Per-user preferences (`UserPreferences` POJO + `user_preferences` table) mirroring the Settings pattern
- CSS theme system with `[data-theme]` selectors and FOUC prevention
- Split CSS: `base.css` (global) + `theme.css` (theme overrides) + page-specific (`tasks.css`, `audit.css`)
- WebSocket + STOMP via `spring-boot-starter-websocket` and STOMP.js 7.1
- Shared STOMP client (`websocket.js`) with `onConnect(callback)` pattern for feature scripts
- Client-side event bus via `CustomEvent` — decouples notification producers (WebSocket, dropdown, page) from consumers (badge, dropdown list, page list)
- Online presence tracking with `ConcurrentHashMap` keyed by user ID (multi-tab safe, name-change safe); broadcast via `/topic/presence`
- Notification persistence with DB-first pattern (save then push) — offline users see notifications on login
- Auto-purge of old notifications via `@Scheduled` cron (admin-configurable retention period, default 30 days)
- Central user-resolution helpers in `SecurityUtils` (replaces duplicated patterns across services, dialects, and listeners)
- Split JS: `utils.js` (global) + page-specific (`tasks.js`, `audit.js`) + WebSocket (`websocket.js`, `presence.js`, `notifications.js`)
- Toast notification system via `showToast()` in `utils.js` (Bootstrap 5 toasts, lazy-created container)
- Styled confirm dialog via `showConfirm()` in `utils.js` (Bootstrap 5 modal, replaces native `confirm()`)
- All `messages.properties` keys served to JavaScript via `APP_CONFIG.messages` in `/config.js`
- Externalized UI strings via `messages.properties` (Spring MessageSource)
- Externalized validation messages via `ValidationMessages.properties` (Hibernate Validator)
- Externalized frontend routes via `@ConfigurationProperties` + `GlobalModelAttributes` (Thymeleaf) and `/config.js` endpoint (JavaScript)
- Hot reload with Spring DevTools

## Usage Guide

### Authentication

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/login. Enter your email and password, or click **Register** to create a new account. New accounts are created with the USER role.

**Roles:**
- **USER** — can create tasks (defaults to self, can assign to others), edit/delete own and unassigned tasks, view all tasks, manage own profile and preferences
- **ADMIN** — full access to all tasks, can manage users (create/edit/delete/disable/enable) and tags, can assign tasks to any user, manage own profile and preferences

### Web Interface

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/tasks (requires login).

#### Viewing Tasks

- **Search** — type to filter tasks by title or description in real time
- **Filter buttons** — All / Open / In Progress / Completed / Overdue
- **Sort dropdown** — sort by title, created date, or description
- **View toggle** — switch between card grid, table, and calendar view
- **Page size** — choose 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 tasks per page

#### Creating a Task

Click **New Task** — a modal opens. Fill in title (required, max 100 chars), description (optional, max 500 chars), priority (Low/Medium/High, defaults to Medium), optional start date and due date, and optional checklist items, then click **Create Task**. Your current search/filter/sort state is preserved.

#### Editing a Task

Click the title or the **Edit** button on any card or table row. The same modal opens pre-filled. In edit mode you can set the status via radio buttons (Open / In Progress / Completed).

#### Advancing Task Status

Click the toggle button on a card or row to advance the task through the lifecycle: OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED → OPEN.

#### Deleting a Task

Click the trash icon, confirm in the styled dialog (Bootstrap modal, not native browser confirm).

### REST API

All API endpoints require authentication. CSRF is disabled for `/api/**`, so you only need a valid session cookie. See `rest.http` for ready-to-use examples.

**To authenticate:** Log in via browser, copy `JSESSIONID` from DevTools → Application → Cookies, and send it as a `Cookie` header.

## Sample Data

`DataLoader.java` seeds on startup: **50 users**, **8 tags** (Work, Personal, Home, Urgent, Someday, Meeting, Research, Errand), **300 tasks** with varied status (Open, In Progress, Completed), creation dates, priorities, start dates, and due dates, **sample comments** on ~30% of tasks (1–3 comments each from random users), **checklist items** on a subset of tasks, **due-date reminder notifications** for Alice's tasks due tomorrow, and the **Workshop theme** as the default — ready to test search, filter, sort, and pagination immediately. ~80% of tasks are assigned to a user; each task gets 1–2 tags. Priority distribution: ~20% HIGH, ~40% MEDIUM, ~40% LOW. ~80% of tasks have a due date spread -10 to +30 days from today (creating a mix of overdue and upcoming). 3 of Alice's tasks are explicitly set to due tomorrow for demo purposes. The first user (Alice Johnson) is an admin; all others are regular users. All passwords are `password`.

## Technologies

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Spring Boot 4.0.3 |
| Language | Java 25 |
| Security | Spring Security 7.0 |
| Database | H2 (in-memory) |
| ORM | Spring Data JPA / Hibernate |
| Validation | Jakarta Validation |
| Templates | Thymeleaf 3.x + Spring Security dialect |
| CSS | Bootstrap 5.3.3 |
| Icons | Bootstrap Icons |
| Dynamic UI | HTMX 2.0.4 |
| @Mentions | Tribute.js |
| Build | Maven |
| Mapping | MapStruct 1.6 |
| Dev Tools | Spring DevTools |
| Monitoring | Spring Actuator |

## Deployment

A multi-stage `Dockerfile` is included for container-based deployment. The build stage compiles with Maven; the runtime stage uses a minimal JRE image.

```bash
docker build -t spring-demo .
docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-demo
```

The app is deployed at [demo.desuka.cc](https://demo.desuka.cc) on [Render](https://render.com) (free tier, Docker runtime). Every push to `main` triggers auto-deploy. Custom domain via Cloudflare DNS (CNAME, no proxy).

> **Note:** H2 is an in-memory database — all data resets on each deploy and on free-tier spin-down. For persistent data, swap H2 for PostgreSQL.

## Troubleshooting

**Application won't start** — check Java 25: `java -version`; check port: `lsof -i :8080`

**`No qualifying bean of type 'TaskMapper'`** — MapStruct generates `TaskMapperImpl` at compile time. Run `./mvnw compile` once so the class exists, then restart the app.

**HTMX not working** — check browser console; verify `HX-Request` header is sent; ensure controller calls `HtmxUtils.isHtmxRequest()`

**Styles not loading** — clear browser cache; check `src/main/resources/static/css/`

**H2 connection error** — no external database needed; verify JDBC URL is `jdbc:h2:mem:taskdb`

**403 after login** — check your role. Admin-only pages (`/admin/**`) and API mutations on tags/users require ADMIN role. Use the admin account or promote a user via `/admin/users`.
