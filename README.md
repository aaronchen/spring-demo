# Spring Workshop

A growing full-stack application built as a hands-on learning project for Spring Boot 4.0, featuring both a REST API and an interactive web UI powered by Thymeleaf and HTMX. New features and patterns are added as we continue exploring Spring Boot together.

**Live Demo:** <a href="https://demo.desuka.cc" target="_blank">demo.desuka.cc</a>

| User | `bob.smith@example.com` | `password` |

## Features

### Projects & Team Collaboration
- **Project Management** - Create, edit, archive, and delete projects; every task belongs to a project
- **Role-Based Project Access** - Three project roles: VIEWER (read-only), EDITOR (read/write tasks), OWNER (full control including settings and member management)
- **Team Members** - Add/remove project members with role assignment; last owner protection prevents accidental lockout
- **Project-Scoped Views** - Task lists, dashboards, and API endpoints scoped to accessible projects; admins see all

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Form Login** - Email + password authentication with BCrypt hashing
- **Self-Registration** - New users can sign up; default role is USER
- **Role-Based Access** - Two system roles: USER (standard) and ADMIN (elevated privileges); three project roles: VIEWER, EDITOR, OWNER
- **Project Access Control** - `ProjectAccessGuard` enforces view/edit/owner access per project; admin bypass for all projects
- **Admin Panel** - Modal-based user management (create/edit/delete/disable/enable) at `/admin/users`; tag management at `/admin/tags` (admin only)
- **Audit Logging** - All entity changes, project member mutations, and auth events logged; admin audit page with search/filters at `/admin/audit`
- **Admin Settings** - Configurable site name, registration toggle, maintenance banner, notification purge age, and theme picker at `/admin/settings`
- **User Profile** - Self-service account management at `/profile`: edit name/email, change password, and configure preferences (task view mode, default user filter, due date reminders)
- **Auth-Aware UI** - Navbar shows user info, role badge, and role-appropriate links

### Web Interface
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly UI built with Bootstrap 5
- **Card, Table, Calendar & Board Views** - Toggle between card grid, sortable table, monthly calendar, and Kanban board; preference persisted via user preferences
- **Kanban Board** - Drag-and-drop tasks between status columns; cards show title, priority badge, assignee initials, and due date
- **Inline Editing** - Toggle edit mode in table view to click-to-edit title, description, priority, status, due date, and effort in place
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - `h` (help), `n` (new task), `s`/`/` (search), `1-4` (switch views), `e` (edit mode in table), `Escape` (close/cancel)
- **Saved Views** - Save current filter/sort/view combinations as named views; recall from dropdown
- **Bulk Actions** - Select tasks in table view with checkboxes (cross-page selection persists); floating action bar for batch status, priority, assign (project-scoped member list), and delete operations; selection clears on filter/search/sort/view change
- **CSV Export** - Download filtered tasks as CSV; respects all active filters (search, status, priority, tags, user, overdue)
- **Real-time Search** - Filter tasks as you type (debounced, 300ms); clear button appears on input
- **Filter Buttons** - All / Open / In Progress / Completed / Overdue with color-coded active states
- **Priority Filter** - Dropdown filter for Low / Medium / High with color-coded button state
- **Sortable Columns** - Sort by title, created date, priority, due date, or description (ascending/descending)
- **Priority Badges** - Color-coded clickable badges (High=red, Medium=yellow, Low=green) with reception bar icons
- **Task Dates** - Optional start date and due date with overdue detection; overdue tasks highlighted in red; completedAt timestamp recorded when task is completed
- **Task Checklist** - Embeddable checklist items on tasks (text + checked state); drag-and-drop reordering via native HTML Drag and Drop API; checklist progress shown on cards and table rows; changes audited in activity timeline
- **Pagination** - Configurable page size (10/25/50/100); top and bottom controls
- **Modal Forms** - Create and edit tasks in a modal overlay; context (filters, search, sort) is preserved
- **Task Dependencies** - Block/unblock relationships between tasks within the same project; cycle detection prevents circular chains; blocked tasks cannot be completed until blockers are resolved; visual indicators on cards, table rows, and board
- **Task Lifecycle** - Six-state status: BACKLOG → OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED; CANCELLED as separate terminal state; toggle button advances through the cycle; status radio buttons in edit form
- **Status-Aware Reassignment** - Reassigning an in-progress task resets its status to OPEN
- **Color-Coded Tasks** - Six-status visual system: grey = backlog, secondary = open, yellow = in progress, cyan = in review, green = completed, dark = cancelled throughout UI
- **Dynamic Updates** - Toggle status and delete without page reloads via HTMX
- **User Assignment** - Assign tasks to users via searchable select dropdown (`@ManyToOne`)
- **Tags** - Tag tasks with multiple labels via checkboxes (`@ManyToMany`)
- **User & Tag Filters** - Filter tasks by assigned user and/or tags; clickable names/badges for quick filtering
- **Task Comments** - Any authenticated user can comment on any task; comment owners and admins can delete comments; real-time count updates via HTMX out-of-band swaps
- **@Mentions in Comments** - Type @ to mention users in comments with Tribute.js autocomplete; atomic backspace for mention tokens; clean display with encoded storage; mentioned users receive notifications and are subscribed to the conversation
- **Unified Activity Timeline** - Comments and audit history merged into a single chronological timeline with visual timeline dots and connecting lines; replaces separate comments panel and audit panel in both modal and full-page views
- **Shared Two-Column Layout** - Task modal and full-page task view share the same layout fragment (`task-layout.html`): form fields on left, checklist + activity timeline on right
- **Styled Confirm Dialog** - Bootstrap modal confirm dialog (`showConfirm`) replaces native browser `confirm()` for delete actions
- **Toast Notifications** - Success/error toasts for task save, delete, and conflict events; clickable toasts for notification links (Bootstrap 5 toasts with slide-in animation)
- **Online Presence** - Real-time online user count and list in navbar via WebSocket + STOMP
- **Notification Bell** - Real-time push notifications with unread badge, dropdown list, mark-as-read, and mark-all-as-read
- **Notifications Page** - Full paginated notification history at `/notifications` with clear-all; live updates via client-side event bus
- **Live Task Updates** - Stale-data banner on task list, detail page, and modal when another user modifies a task; click to refresh with current filters
- **Live Comment Updates** - Auto-refresh comment lists and counts when another user adds or deletes comments; works in both modal and full-page views
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Six interactive Chart.js charts: status breakdown, priority breakdown, workload distribution (stacked bar by assignee), 30-day burndown, 12-week velocity, and overdue-by-assignee; available cross-project (`/analytics` with project filter checkboxes) and per-project (`/projects/{id}/analytics`)
- **Real-Time Dashboard** - Per-project stats (open/in-progress/completed/overdue) with clickable cards linking to filtered task list, due-this-week tasks, recent tasks, and activity feed; admin-only system overview across all projects; auto-refreshes via WebSocket on task and presence changes
- **Sprints** - Optional time-boxed iterations per project; date-range-based status (past/active/future); non-overlapping enforcement; sprint filter on task views (active sprint / backlog / all); sprint-scoped analytics with burndown using sprint date range; managed via project settings page
- **Recurring Task Templates** - Automated task generation for non-sprint projects; DAILY/WEEKLY/BIWEEKLY/MONTHLY recurrence; configurable day-of-week/month, relative due dates, optional end date; scheduled 6 AM generation with missed-date skip; auto-disable at end date; managed via project settings with split "New Task" button
- **Due Date Reminders** - Daily scheduled notifications for tasks due tomorrow; per-user opt-in/out via profile preferences
- **Theme System** - Three color schemes (Default, Workshop, Sapphire) switchable from admin settings; CSS custom properties with FOUC prevention
- **Maintenance Banner** - Dismissible site-wide alert banner configurable from admin settings
- **Dynamic Site Name** - Customizable site name shown in navbar, footer, and page titles

### REST API
- **RESTful Endpoints** - Complete CRUD for tasks, tags, and users via JSON API
- **Data Validation** - Input validation with structured JSON error responses
- **Optimistic Locking** - `@Version` on Task entity; stale updates return 409 Conflict
- **Ownership Enforcement** - Task PUT/DELETE require owner or admin; POST auto-assigns to caller
- **Role Restrictions** - Tag and user mutations (POST/DELETE) restricted to admins
- **Search & Filter** - Query tasks by keyword and status
- **Toggle Status** - Quick PATCH endpoint advances task through BACKLOG → OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED cycle
- **Task Comments** - Nested comment endpoints under each task
- **Notifications** - Unread count, paginated list, mark read, mark all read, clear all
- **Presence** - Online user count and list

### Audit Logging
- **Event-Driven** - Services publish audit events via `ApplicationEventPublisher`; listener persists to database
- **Tracked Actions** - Project CRUD and member management, task CRUD, comment create/delete, user CRUD (including disable/enable), tag CRUD, settings changes, auth success/failure, role changes, registration, profile changes
- **Field-Level Diffs** - Update events record before/after values for each changed field
- **Admin Audit Page** - Searchable, filterable audit log at `/admin/audit` with dynamically generated category buttons (from `AuditEvent.CATEGORIES`), text search, date range, and pagination
- **Task History** - Per-task audit trail shown in unified activity timeline alongside comments

### Error Handling
- **Dual exception handlers** - `ApiExceptionHandler` returns RFC 9457 ProblemDetail JSON for REST; `WebExceptionHandler` returns Thymeleaf pages for web
- **Custom error pages** - 400 (Bad Request), 403 (Access Denied), 404 (Not Found), 409 (Conflict), 500 (Server Error)
- **RFC 9457 ProblemDetail** - Structured `application/problem+json` responses with `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail` fields; validation errors include field-level `errors` map

### Technical Highlights
- Spring Boot 4.0.5 with Java 25
- Spring Security 7.0 with form login, BCrypt, and role-based access control
- Custom Thymeleaf dialect (`${#auth}`) for ownership/role checks in templates
- H2 in-memory database (easy development setup)
- Spring Data JPA with Specifications for dynamic filtering
- Event-driven side effects — services publish domain events; three independent listeners handle audit logging, notifications, and WebSocket broadcasting
- Project-scoped access control via `ProjectAccessGuard` with VIEWER/EDITOR/OWNER roles; admin bypass
- Service-to-service composition (TaskService delegates to TagService/UserService instead of direct repository access)
- Generic `@Unique` validation annotation — class-level, `@Repeatable`, uses `EntityManager` JPQL for uniqueness checks with self-exclusion on edit
- Global string trimming via `GlobalBindingConfig` (`StringTrimmerEditor`) — trims all form fields, converts blank to null
- User enable/disable pattern — disabled users can't log in and are hidden from assignment dropdowns; users with completed tasks or comments can only be disabled (not deleted)
- Entity `FIELD_*` constants for field names (no hardcoded strings in audit snapshots or specifications)
- `get`/`find` naming convention: `getXxx()` throws `EntityNotFoundException`, `findXxx()` returns null
- Paginated REST API (`GET /api/tasks`) with search, status, priority, overdue, user, and tag filters via Spring Data `Pageable`
- OpenAPI 3.1 documentation via springdoc-openapi — Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html`, JSON spec at `/api-docs`
- DTO layer (`TaskRequest` / `TaskResponse`) with MapStruct for compile-time mapping
- Thymeleaf with shared fragment architecture
- HTMX 2.0 for dynamic interactions, HX-Trigger events, and out-of-band swaps
- Stimulus 3.2 for JavaScript behavior via controllers and ES module imports (no global functions or script tag ordering)
- Tribute.js for @mention autocomplete in comment input
- Bootstrap 5.3 for styling
- Reusable pagination fragment with custom DOM events
- Typed `Settings` POJO with `BeanWrapper` auto-mapping from DB key/value rows
- Per-user preferences (`UserPreferences` POJO + `user_preferences` table) mirroring the Settings pattern
- CSS theme system with `[data-theme]` selectors and FOUC prevention
- Split CSS: `base.css` (global) + `theme.css` (theme overrides) + page-specific (`tasks.css`, `audit.css`)
- WebSocket + STOMP via `spring-boot-starter-websocket` and STOMP.js 7.3
- Shared STOMP client (`lib/websocket.js`) ES module with `onConnect(callback)` pattern, imported by Stimulus controllers
- Client-side event bus via `CustomEvent` (`lib/notifications.js`) — decouples notification producers (WebSocket, dropdown, page) from consumers (badge, dropdown list, page list)
- Online presence tracking with `ConcurrentHashMap` keyed by user ID (multi-tab safe, name-change safe); broadcast via `/topic/presence`
- Notification persistence with DB-first pattern (save then push) — offline users see notifications on login
- Auto-purge of old notifications via `@Scheduled` cron (admin-configurable retention period, default 30 days)
- Central user-resolution helpers in `SecurityUtils` (replaces duplicated patterns across services, dialects, and listeners)
- `Translatable` enum interface — enums store their own `messages.properties` key; `Messages.get(Translatable)` resolves display names; templates use `#{${enum.messageKey}}`
- Stimulus 3.2.2 + ES modules via import maps: `application.js` bootstraps controllers, `js/controllers/` for page behavior, `js/lib/` for shared modules, `js/components/` for Web Components
- Toast notification system via `showToast()` in `lib/toast.js` (Bootstrap 5 toasts, lazy-created container)
- Styled confirm dialog via `showConfirm()` in `lib/confirm.js` (Bootstrap 5 modal, replaces native `confirm()`)
- All `messages.properties` keys served to JavaScript via `APP_CONFIG.messages` in `/config.js`
- Externalized UI strings via `messages.properties` (Spring MessageSource)
- Externalized validation messages via `ValidationMessages.properties` (Hibernate Validator)
- Externalized frontend routes via `@ConfigurationProperties` + `GlobalModelAttributes` (Thymeleaf) and `/config.js` endpoint (JavaScript)
- Spotless + google-java-format (AOSP style, 4-space indent) enforced at compile time
- 207 automated tests: unit (Mockito), repository (@DataJpaTest), integration (MockMvc), validation, security
- CI pipeline: GitHub Actions runs `./mvnw verify` on every push to main and PR
- Spring profiles: `dev` (H2, demo data), `test` (isolated H2, no data seeding), `prod` (PostgreSQL, Flyway migrations)
- Flyway schema migrations for production (PostgreSQL); dev/test use Hibernate `create-drop`
- Spring Actuator health and info endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`)
- Hot reload with Spring DevTools

## Usage Guide

### Authentication

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/login. Enter your email and password, or click **Register** to create a new account. New accounts are created with the USER role.

**Roles:**
- **USER** — can create projects and tasks within their projects, edit/delete tasks based on project role (VIEWER/EDITOR/OWNER), manage own profile and preferences
- **ADMIN** — full access to all projects and tasks, can manage users (create/edit/delete/disable/enable) and tags, bypasses all project access checks, manage own profile and preferences

### Web Interface

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/tasks (requires login).

#### Viewing Tasks

- **Search** — type to filter tasks by title or description in real time
- **Filter buttons** — All / Backlog / Open / In Progress / In Review / Completed / Cancelled / Overdue
- **Sort dropdown** — sort by title, created date, priority, due date, updated date, or description
- **View toggle** — switch between card grid, table, calendar, and Kanban board view
- **Page size** — choose 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 tasks per page

#### Creating a Task

Click **New Task** — a modal opens. Select a project from the dropdown (pre-selected if you're on a project page), fill in title (required, max 100 chars), description (optional, max 500 chars), priority (Low/Medium/High, defaults to Medium), optional start date, due date, and effort (points/hours), and optional checklist items, then click **Create Task**. Tasks can be created from any page with the New Task button. Your current search/filter/sort state is preserved.

#### Editing a Task

Click the title or the **Edit** button on any card or table row. The same modal opens pre-filled. In edit mode you can set the status via radio buttons (Backlog / Open / In Progress / In Review / Completed / Cancelled).

#### Advancing Task Status

Click the toggle button on a card or row to advance the task through the lifecycle: BACKLOG → OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED → OPEN.

#### Deleting a Task

Click the trash icon, confirm in the styled dialog (Bootstrap modal, not native browser confirm).

### REST API

All API endpoints require authentication. CSRF is disabled for `/api/**`, so you only need a valid session cookie. See `rest.http` for ready-to-use examples.

**To authenticate:** Log in via browser, copy `JSESSIONID` from DevTools → Application → Cookies, and send it as a `Cookie` header.

## Sample Data

`DataLoader.java` seeds on startup: **4 projects** (Platform, Product, Security, Ops) with team members across different roles, **20 users**, **8 tags** (Bug, Feature, DevOps, Security, Documentation, Spike, Blocked, Tech Debt), **56 tasks** distributed across projects with varied status (Backlog, Open, In Progress, In Review, Completed, Cancelled), creation dates, priorities, start dates, and due dates, **sample comments** on ~30% of tasks (1–3 comments each from random users), **checklist items** on a subset of tasks, **due-date reminder notifications** for Alice's tasks due tomorrow, and the **Workshop theme** as the default — ready to test search, filter, sort, and pagination immediately. ~80% of tasks are assigned to a user; each task gets 1–2 tags. Priority distribution: ~20% HIGH, ~40% MEDIUM, ~40% LOW. ~80% of tasks have a due date spread -10 to +30 days from today (creating a mix of overdue and upcoming). 3 of Alice's tasks are explicitly set to due tomorrow for demo purposes. The first user (Alice Johnson) is an admin; all others are regular users. All passwords are `password`.

## Deployment

### Docker

A multi-stage `Dockerfile` is included for container-based deployment. The build stage compiles with Maven; the runtime stage uses a minimal JRE image.

```bash
docker build -t spring-demo .
docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-demo
```

For local prod testing with PostgreSQL, use the Docker Compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build    # PostgreSQL + app on port 8081
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down -v        # stop and clean up
```

### Spring Profiles

| Profile | Database | Flyway | Schema | Use case |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| `dev` | H2 in-memory | Off | `create-drop` | Default — fast dev, data resets on restart |
| `test` | H2 in-memory | Off | `create-drop` | Automated tests |
| `prod` | PostgreSQL | On | `validate` | Production — persistent data |

### Render

The app is deployed at [demo.desuka.cc](https://demo.desuka.cc) on [Render](https://render.com) (Starter plan, Docker runtime). Every push to `main` triggers auto-deploy. Custom domain via Cloudflare DNS (CNAME, no proxy).

Currently runs with the `dev` profile (H2 in-memory). To switch to PostgreSQL: create a Render PostgreSQL instance, then set `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` and `DATABASE_URL` as environment variables on the web service.

> **Note:** With the dev profile, all data resets on each deploy and on free-tier spin-down.

### CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and PR targeting `main`:
1. Sets up JDK 25
2. Caches Maven dependencies
3. Runs `./mvnw verify` (compile + 207 tests)

## Troubleshooting

**Application won't start** — check Java 25: `java -version`; check port: `lsof -i :8080`

**`No qualifying bean of type 'TaskMapper'`** — MapStruct generates `TaskMapperImpl` at compile time. Run `./mvnw compile` once so the class exists, then restart the app.

**HTMX not working** — check browser console; verify `HX-Request` header is sent; ensure controller calls `HtmxUtils.isHtmxRequest()`

**Styles not loading** — clear browser cache; check `src/main/resources/static/css/`

**H2 connection error** — no external database needed; verify JDBC URL is `jdbc:h2:mem:taskdb`

**403 after login** — check your role. Admin-only pages (`/admin/**`) and API mutations on tags/users require ADMIN role. Use the admin account or promote a user via `/admin/users`.
